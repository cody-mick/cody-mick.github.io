# 2048

This is a 2048 clone that I created while following along with a tutorial from Web Dev Simplified. Click on the link below to go to that tutorial.

This was a very education experience and I wanted to be able to refresh my JavaScript and CSS knowledge after not needing a ton of it this semester as I have focused mainly on backend development for the past couple months. While there are things in the project that I would have never thought of, it is nice to see some of the ways that JavaScript programming is approached, and some of the different methods and tactics to be able to create an application that is just about ready to go.
I want to ultimately code in a win condition, which will be checking to see if any of the tiles have a value of 2048, and then the ability to be able to keep playing after that to see how far you can go.
This was a fantastic learning experience, and I'll definitely need to look over this code more as I go through it again.
