            The City of Rigby was founded in 1884 by pioneers from The Church of
            Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The settlement was named after
            William F. Rigby, a prominent member of the settlers. Rigby is the
            county seat of Jefferson County.
            <br><br>
            Rigby is also known as the "Birthplace of Television", as Philo T.
            Farnsworth, the inventor of the television tube, spent his childhood
            in Rigby, and became very interested in electronics while living
            here. Though Farnsworth's original patent wasn't filed until he
            moved to Los Angeles in 1926, it is believed that he would not have
            been able to invent the tube without first moving to Rigby and
            falling in love with electronics. There is a museum in the town
            dedicated to him, and an entire exhibit about his invention on
            display year round.

          Rigby is also home to a number of potato warehouses, as the community
          is known for being involved in Idaho's number one export: potatoes. Most
          people in Rigby work in the agriculture industry, and those that do
          not commute to the nearby towns of Rexburg and Idaho Falls. Rigby is
          also a popular place to live for those working at the Idaho National
          Laboratory.
