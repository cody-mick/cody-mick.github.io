              No questions from the reading or the videos. The exercises I chose
              to work on went smoothly as well.

          <p>
              Not too many notes from this chapter. Mostly just a little bit of
              review. Worked on the story editor example from the book to refresh a
              little bit on localStorage.

                Keep in mind that some people don't have the latest and greatest as
                far as connectivity.

              <li>
                Clean up unused code and assets, GZIP files, use SVG, and keep an eye
                on performance
