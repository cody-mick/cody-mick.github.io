        <li>OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IS CONFUSING SOMETIMES.</li>
        <li>Encapsulation</li>
        <li>Polymorphism</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>These words have terrified me in previous classes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
      <p>
        The inner workings are kept inside the object. Only the essential
        functionalities are exposed to the end user.
      </p>
      <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
      <p>
        Various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to
        override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
        The same process can be used for different objects.
      </p>
      <h4>Inheritance</h4>
      <p>
        Taking the features of one object and then adding new features.
        We can take an object that already exists, inherit all its properties
        and methods. We can improve on its quality by adding new properties
        and methods.
