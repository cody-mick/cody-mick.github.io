        <h2>Ch. 9: The Window Object</h2>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (BOM for short)</p>
        <p>
          There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number
          of properties and methods that are supported by all of the major
          browsers, making a sort of de facto standard. These are made available
          through the window object. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame,
          and iframe has a window object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Global variables are declared without using const, let, or var. When a
          variable is global, it is accessible to the entire program. Global
          variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser
          environment, the global object is the window object. This means that
          any global variable created is actually a property of the window
          object.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            x = 6; //global variable created
            << 6
            window.x //same variable can be accessed as a property of the window object.
            << 6
            window.x === x;
            << true
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In general, you should refer to global variable without using the
          window object
        </p>
        <p>
          The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and
          display a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an
          argument to the method, and undefined is always returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program to
          display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an
          argument, and giving the options of OK or cancel. It returns the
          boolean values of true if the user clicks ok, and false if the user
          clicks cancel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It
          displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as
          well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. The text is
          then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks
          Cancel, null is returned.
        </p>
        <h3>window.location</h3>
        <p>All methods and properties are used in the format:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            window.location.property (or method)
            // where property is the property or method being used.
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Properties</p>
        <ul>
          <li>href - Returns the full URL as a string</li>
          <li>
            protocol - Returns a string describing the protocol used. i.e. http,
            https, pop2, ftp, etc
          </li>
          <li>
            host - Returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and
            the port number. Port number is omitted if the default port 80 is
            used.
          </li>
          <li>
            hostname - Returns a string describing the domain of the current URL
          </li>
          <li>
            port - Returns a string describing the port number, although it will
            return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the
            URL
          </li>
          <li>
            pathname - Returns a string of the path that follows the domain.
          </li>
          <li>
            search - Returns a string that starts with a "?" followed by the
            query string parameters. Returns an empty string if there are no
            query string parameters
          </li>
          <li>
            hash - Returns a string that starts with a "#" followed by the
            fragment identifier. Returns empty string if there is no fragment
            identifier
          </li>
          <li>
            origin - Returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where
            the current page originated from. The property is read only and
            cannot be changed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Methods</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            reload() - Can be used to force a reload of the current page. If
            given a parameter of true, it will force the browser to reload the
            page from the server, instead of using a cached page.
          </li>
          <li>
            assign() - can be used to load another resource from a URL provided
            as a parameter.
          </li>
          <li>
            replace() - like the assign() method, but the current page will not
            be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to
            navigate back to it using the back button.
          </li>
          <li>toString() - Returns a string containing the whole URL</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Browser History</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            window.history - used to access information about any previously
            visited pages in the current browser session.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.history.length - shows how many pages have been visited
            before arriving at the current page.
          </li>
          <li>
            window. history.go() - can be used to go to a specific page, where 0
            is the current page.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.history.forward/.backward - used to navigate forward and
            backward one page, respectively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A new window can be opened using the window.open() method, and
          .close() can be used to close a window assuming you have the reference
          to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          window.moveTo() will move to a window. And you can use
          window.resizeTo() to resize a window.
        </p>
        <h3>Screen Information</h3>
        <p>window.screen</p>
        <ul>
          <li>height - returns the height of the window in pixels</li>
          <li>width - returns the width of the window in pixels</li>
          <li>
            availHeight / availWidth - used to find the heigh and width of the
            screen, excluding any operating system menus
          </li>
          <li>
            colorDepth - can be used to find the color bit depth of the user's
            monitor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Document Object</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            document.write() - writes a string of text to the page. If a page
            has already loaded, it will completely replace the current document.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer.
          They were invented by Netscape as a way of getting around HTTP being a
          stateless protocol. Cookies can be used to store information that can
          be retrieved between requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies can only be read by a web page from the same domain that set
          them. Cookies are also limited to storing up to 4KB of data, although
          20 cookies are allowed per domain, which can be a lot of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript's "cookie jar", using
          document.cookie. The document.cookie property acts like a special type
          of string. Assigning another cookie to it won't overwrite the entire
          property, it will just append it to the end of the string.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies are session cookies by default. This means that they are
          deleted once a browser session is finished. You can change this by
          adding an expiration date to the cookie.
        </p>
        <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            window.setTimeout() - accepts a callback to a function as its first
            parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.clearTimeout() - used to clear the timeout method before the
            timer reaches 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.setInterval() - will repeatedly invoke the callback function
            after every given number of milliseconds. Can also be cleared using
            window.clearInterval.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          setTimeout() and setInterval() can also be used to animate elements on
          a page:
        </p>

        <h2>Ch. 14 HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <h3>HTML5 Web Storage</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's
          computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions,
          more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.
        </p>
        <p>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information is not shared with the server on every request</li>
          <li>
            Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but
            only if the domain is the same)
          </li>
          <li>
            Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for
            cookies. (There is no actual limit on the specification, but most
            browsers have a limit of 5GB (5,000,000KB) per domain.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with
            cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for
            something like showing a popup once a day.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have
          a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number
          of properties and methods used to store data. The information is saved
          in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings.
          There is also a sessionStorage object that works in the same way,
          although the data is only stored for the current session.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');
            localStorage.getItem('name');
            << Walter White
            // or you could use
            localStorage.name = "Heisenberg";
            console.log(localStorage.name);
            << Heisenberg
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          To remove an item entirely from localStorage use the removeItem
          method.
        </p>
        <p>
          To completely remove everything stored in localStorage use the clear()
          method.
        </p>
        <p>Storage events have properties that tell us about the object:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>key tells us the key of the item that changed</li>
          <li>newValue tells us the new value to which it has been changed</li>
          <li>oldValue tells us the previous value before it was changed</li>
          <li>
            storageArea tells us if it is stored in local or session storage
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use the stringify method to store things in localStorage if it is more
          than just a string. Like an object.
        </p>
        <h3>Geolocation API</h3>
        <p>
          The geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the
          device. This means it can be used to find the user's exact location,
          then link nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is
          moving. Permission has to be granted in order to use this
          functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          If geolocation is available, it will be a property of the navigator
          object. This property has a method called getCurrentPosition() that
          will return a position object to a specified callback function.
        </p>
        <p>
          The position object has several other properties that can be used to
          find out information about the location and movement of the device.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            position.speed - returns the ground speed of the device in meters
            per second
          </li>
          <li>
            position.altitude - returns an estimate of the device's altitude in
            meters above the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement
            for the center of the Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            position.heading - returns the direction the device is moving in.
            Measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from North.
          </li>
          <li>
            position.timestamp - returns the time that the position information
            was recorded.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notification API</h3>
        <p>
          The notification API allows you to show messages using the system's
          notifications. Before you can send notifications, you need to get
          permission from the user. This is achieved using the requestPermission()
          method of a notification global object.
        </p>
        <h3>Media API</h3>
        <p>
          You can use audio and video tags to insert audio and video into a webpage.
