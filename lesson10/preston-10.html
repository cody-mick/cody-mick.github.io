        <h3>A Key Ingredient Will Keep Fruit Salad from Going Brown.</h3>
        <p>By Laura Sant</p>

        <p class="article-content">
          Now that spring is here and summer is on the way, it is a great time
          to enjoy the fresh fruits of the season in a salad. Yet, these
          vibrant, luscious fruits don‚Äôt tend to last very long and turn brown
          rapidly. Happily, the juice of the springtime citrus fruit (lemon) can
          keep fruit salad fresh for hours.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Why does fruit salad turn brown?</strong>
          <br><br>
          After carefully cutting and combining various slices of apple,
          strawberry, or banana, the pieces of fruit begin to turn brown before
          long. This is a result of oxidation. When fruit is exposed to oxygen
          (the air), it starts a process called enzymic browning. This makes
          your fruit turn brown. While this process doesn‚Äôt usually affect the
          taste of the fruit, it makes it look less appealing. 
          <br><br>
          <strong>Why does lemon juice help?</strong>
          <br><br>
          To prevent the effects of oxidation, fruit needs citric acid, and
          lemons are full of it. As a natural antioxidant, lemon juice can help
          prolong the life of fruit salad (as well as its visual appeal) by
          inactivating the enzyme polyphenol oxidase, which is responsible for
          the browning. Besides keeping fruit salad fresh, lemon juice can also
          enhance its flavor. The acidic bite of the citrus emphasizes the
          sweetness of the other fruits, and also helps bring out their juices.
          <br><br>
          <strong>How much lemon juice should I use in fruit salad?</strong>
          <br><br>
          To keep the taste of lemon from overwhelming all the other flavors in
          the salad, try using two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon
          of sugar for every four cups of fruit. Combine the lemon and sugar in
          a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved, then pour the mixture onto
          the fruit salad. However, the amount of lemon juice you use is
          ultimately up to you. If you like a tart bite to fruit salads,
          increase the amount of lemon juice you add. For extra protection
          against oxidation, use a wooden spoon to mix the finished product
          rather than metal.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Use sturdy fruits</strong>
          <br><br>
          Your fruit salad should reflect your favorite fruits, but if you‚Äôre
          looking for longevity, some ingredients are better suited to storage
          than others.
          <ul>
            <li>Store Better ‚Äî apples, oranges, peaches, mangos,
              blueberries, and grapes</li>
            <li>Don‚Äôt Store Well ‚Äî bananas, watermelon,
                raspberries, and strawberries</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <strong>What else can I do to help keep my fruit salad fresh?</strong>
          <br><br>
          Keep fruit salad covered and refrigerated until ready to serve. Store
          leftovers tightly covered in the refrigerator.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Reduce Chopping</strong>
          <br><br>
          To increase the amount of time your fruit salad lasts, roughly chop it
          into larger pieces. This keeps the fruit from leaking too much juice.
          For fruits with edible skins, leave the skins on. Whatever fruit you
          enjoy, there are a plethora of fruits coming into season. With this
          knowledge ‚Äî and a few slices of lemon ‚Äî you are well-equipped to win
          the battle between fresh fruit salad and the open air.
