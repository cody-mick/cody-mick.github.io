        <h3>Idaho marks 131 years since becoming the nation‚Äôs 43rd state</h3>
        <p>By Rett Nelson - <em>East Idaho News</em></p>

        <p class="article-content">
          People throughout eastern Idaho are gathered with friends and family
          Saturday to celebrate America‚Äôs independence. Many celebrations
          throughout the state are happening on July 3 this year because July 4
          falls on a Sunday. <br /><br />

          But July 3 is another significant date for residents of the Gem State.
          It is the 131st anniversary of Idaho becoming a state. On July 3,
          1890, Idaho officially became the 43rd state in the U.S. <br /><br />

          Since it officially became a territory on March 4, 1863, it has grown
          from a fledgling state of roughly 88,000 people to the state with the
          second-highest growth in the nation with a total population of
          1,839,106, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data released in
          April. <br /><br />
          Twenty-seven years priors when the U.S. was in the midst of the Civil
          War, President Abraham Lincoln officially created the Idaho territory.
          The prospect of making more space for the transcontinental railroad
          was an attractive idea to Lincoln, along with the area‚Äôs abundance of
          mineral deposits and natural resources. The State Symbols USA website
          says Idaho has 72 types of precious and semi-precious stones, some of
          which are found nowhere else in the world. This is how Idaho got
          nicknamed the Gem State. <br /><br />

          Museum displays do not specifically state why statehood was such a
          divisive issue, but its natural resources and geographic features
          likely had something to do with it. <br /><br />

          In an interview with KTVB last year, retired Idaho State Historian
          Keith Petersen elaborated on the conflict in the northern and southern
          part of the state and all that was happening in the Idaho territory at
          that time. <br /><br />

          ‚ÄúNevada was making a play to annex much of southern Idaho,‚Äù Petersen
          said. ‚ÄúThe most serious action came in 1887 when both houses of the
          United States Congress passed a bill which would have allowed the
          Idaho panhandle to secede from Idaho and join Washington, but
          President Grover Cleveland refused to sign it so it was
          pocket-vetoed.‚Äù <br /><br />
          The movement for statehood gained a lot of momentum the following
          year. Petersen explains there were a growing number of members of The
          Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints settling in the territory.
          Latter-day Saints voted primarily Democrat in those days because
          Democratic presidents were the most sympathetic to the church‚Äôs views
          on polygamy. (Church leaders later abolished the practice of polygamy
          in 1890). Cleveland was a Democrat and so there would‚Äôve been a lot of
          support for him among church members during the election in 1888 had
          it not been for a piece of legislation passed four years earlier.
          Republican state lawmakers established the Idaho Test Oath prevented
          Latter-day Saints from voting, holding public office or serving on a
          jury, according to Jstor.org. <br /><br />

          ‚ÄúIdaho became a really dominant Republican state politically because
          Mormons were no longer able to vote,‚Äù said Petersen. ‚ÄúRepublicans won
          the presidency and both houses of the United States Congress. So the
          Idaho Republican Party had strong allies in Washington, D.C. suddenly.
          All of a sudden, the idea of Idaho perhaps becoming a state gained
          great momentum.‚Äù <br /><br />
          The Republican-elected President Benjamin Harrison was sworn into
          office on March 4, 1889 and signed Idaho into statehood more than a
          year later. In 2014, the Idaho Legislature established March 4 as
          Idaho Day to commemorate the creation of the territory in 1863. <br />
