        <h3>Top 5 dog friendly places to visit in Idaho</h3>
        <p><em>From East Idaho News</em></p>
        <div>
          The old cliche that dogs are a man‚Äôs best friend rings true for
          millions. The problem is knowing where to take those wonderful
          furballs for fun. <br /><br />

          Dogs bring so much happiness and joy, it‚Äôs only natural to want to do
          something for them. <br /><br />

          Here is a selection of five of the best places to take Spot to
          socialize, exercise and play throughout Idaho. Just be sure to pick up
          after the pooch.<br /><br />
          <strong>City Creek Trail System ‚Äì Pocatello</strong><br /><br />

          The city of Pocatello is nestled into a beautiful mountainscape giving
          hikers and dog lovers access to thousands of acres of public land and
          the Portneuf River.<br /><br />
          <strong>Winstead Park ‚Äì Boise</strong><br /><br />

          A nice relaxing day at the park is sometimes just what the doctor
          ordered. Winstead Park offers ample area for off-leash play with signs
          and maps showing just where four-legged friends are welcome.<br /><br />
          <strong>Island Park Off-Leash Dog Zone</strong><br /><br />

          Island Park is one of Idaho‚Äôs great treasures visited countless people
          many of whom bring their dogs. The Off-Leash Dog Zone is a fantastic
          place pups with a fence on one side and water on the other three
          sides.<br /><br />
          <strong>Victor to Driggs Rail-Trail ‚Äì Victor</strong><br /><br />

          Rails-to-Trails Conservancy is a nonprofit organization that works to
          convert former rail lines into trails. The Victor to Driggs Rail-Trail
          is a fantastic place to bring dogs for a nice walk or hike.<br /><br />
          <strong>Dog Beach Park ‚Äì Sandpoint</strong><br /><br />

          It takes a bit of a walk to get to but this little soft-sanded beach
          on the Pend Oreille River has cool clear water perfect for a day out
          with a water-loving dog. Locals say it‚Äôs a five to 10-minute walk up a
          bike trail from the Conoco gas station just of the Sandpoint exit on
          the highway.<br /><br />
