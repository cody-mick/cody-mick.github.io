          <em>Since many people will be traveling to Idaho Falls for the parade and fireworks show, the following information is being displayed.</em><br><br>

          IDAHO FALLS ‚Äî The community is excited to fully celebrate Independence
          day this weekend, especially since most of the events were canceled
          last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Idaho Falls Parks
          and Recreation Department wants to remind the community that marking
          or saving spaces for the parade route isn‚Äôt allowed on city property
          until Saturday, July 3, at 6:00 a.m. Any items found on city property
          before then will be removed by the city. This includes places like the
          Aquatic Center and Tautphaus Park. Items like blankets, tarps, chairs,
          pop-up tents, etc. can‚Äôt be placed until Saturday. ‚ÄúWe understand that
          everyone is excited for the parade,‚Äù said Parks and Recreation
          Director PJ Holm in a press release. ‚ÄúHowever, every year people put
          things out to save space that end up damaging grass, landscaping,
          sprinklers or other property. We want everyone to have fun, but please
          follow the rules and help us keep things safe and in good condition so
          everyone can enjoy the day.‚Äù Also, the community is not allowed to
          stake the ground for any reason, even after 6:00 a.m. tomorrow. This
          can damage the property or sprinkler systems in the ground, and can be
          an overall safety concern. <br><br>
          While this applies to city property,
          residents should be mindful about placing items on and not damaging
          private property as well. Parking along the parade route is not
          allowed starting July 3 at 5:00 a.m. until the parade is over,
          according to the Idaho Falls Police department. Any vehicle parked
          along the route risks a ticket or having it towed. <br><br>
          The following roads
          will be closed due to the parade at the specified times on Saturday: <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>6:00 a.m. John Adams Parkway, including the branches that connect to
              4th Street and 5th Street</li>
            <li>From Tiger Ave to S Holmes Ave. 8:00 a.m.</li>
            <li>South Boulevard from N Water Ave to W Sunnyside Road. 9:00 a.m. and later.</li>
            <li>The intersection of South Holmes Ave and 4th Street will close at the start of the parade.</li>
          </ul>
          South Holmes Ave will reopen after the
          parade has passed. The intersection of South Holmes and East 17th
          Street will close when the parade reaches 10th street and will remain
          closed until the parade has passed. Motorists are asked to avoid the
          area if they are not attending the parade and to otherwise use caution
          in the area, as foot traffic is very high even hours before the parade
          begins. <br><br> If you have an item that has been removed by the city, it can
          be retrieved by contacting the Idaho Falls Parks Maintenance Office at
          (208) 612-8479 during regular business hours next week. It will be
          closed Monday, July 5th, but open for the week on Tuesday. The city
          will only remove items placed on city property, but owners of private
          property may remove items from their areas. The parade, called the
          ‚ÄúLiberty on Parade‚Äù Independence Day Parade, begins Saturday, July
          3rd, at 9 a.m. More information can be found on the Greater Idaho
          Falls Chamber of Commerce  <a href="https://idahofallschamber.com/event/liberty-on-parade-celebrating-commerce-community/">website.</a>
