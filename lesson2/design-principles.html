        <h2>The Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <h3>Build in Amsterdam</h3>
        <img src="images/Build In Amsterdam.png" />
        <p>
          I chose this site because in the desktop view, the images are spread
          into a perfect third of the page, and they used contrasting colors to
          make each column pop. When shrunk down into the mobile view, the
          website maintained that evenly spaced feel by stacking all the images
          as squares one right after the other. I think the design translated
          well into the mobile version, and the desktop view makes excellent use
          of the rule of thirds.

        <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
        <h3>Apple, Inc.</h3>
        <img src="images/apple website screenshot.png" />
        <p>
          I chose Apple because of how their design responds to being shrunk
          down. The website turns all of the headlines into equally sized tiles
          that you can scroll through. Some of the images change to make better
          use of the space, and others stay the same because they are
          universally usable. Each tile is the same exact size, and if there is
          one full tile on the screen, you can see partial tiles of the tile
          above as well as the one below. I would say it is an excellent use of
          repetition.

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>Angara</h3>
        <img src="images/Angara Mobile View.png" />
        <p>
          I chose this site because their layour was very responsive, and really
          clean. Clean images and smooth transitions we perfectly translated to
          a mobile view, and the company makes good use of white space, and
          clean, straight design. They are not blasting you with so much
          information that you have no idea what is going on, and they make
          excellent use of infographics and quick summaries of information.
          Really clean, really sleek, and just pleasing to look at.
