        I chose this site because in the desktop view, the images are spread
        into a perfect third of the page, and they used contrasting colors to
        make each column pop. When shrunk down into the mobile view, the website
        maintained that evenly spaced feel by stacking all the images as squares
        one right after the other. I think the design translated well into the
        mobile version, and the desktop view makes excellent use of the rule of
        thirds.

        I chose Apple because of how their design responds to being shrunk down.
        There are animations and big wide displays when viewing the website on a
        desktop, but when shrunk down into the mobile view, The website turns
        all of the headlines into equally sized tiles that you can scroll
        through. Some of the images change to make better use of the space, and
        others stay the same because they are universally usable. Each tile is
        the same exact size, and if there is one full tile on the screen, you
        can see partial tiles of the tile above as well as the one below, giving
        a great lead for a person to follow. And there ended up being something
        like 6 or 7 tiles to scroll through before getting to the footer, which
        gives a person plenty of time to see if they can find what they are
        looking for. I would say it is an excellent use of repetition to make
        the mobile design feel just as inviting as the desktop site.

        I chose this site because their layour was very responsive, and really
        clean. Clean images and smooth transitions we perfectly translated to a
        mobile view, and the company makes good use of white space, and clean,
        straight design. They are not blasting you with so much information that
        you have no idea what is going on, and they make excellent use of
        infographics and quick summaries of information. Really clean, really
        sleek, and just pleasing to look at.
