        I chose Apple because of how their design responds to being shrunk down.
        There are animations and big wide displays when viewing the website on a
        desktop, but when shrunk down into the mobile view, The website turns
        all of the headlines into equally sized tiles that you can scroll
        through. Some of the images change to make better use of the space, and
        others stay the same because they are universally usable. Each tile is
        the same exact size, and if there is one full tile on the screen, you
        can see partial tiles of the tile above as well as the one below, giving
        a great lead for a person to follow. And there ended up being something
        like 6 or 7 tiles to scroll through before getting to the footer, which
        gives a person plenty of time to see if they can find what they are
        looking for. I would say it is an excellent use of repetition to make
        the mobile design feel just as inviting as the desktop site.
