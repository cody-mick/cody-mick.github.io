    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
      The target audience for this site is people who want to know the weather.
      And even more than that, the site is designed to suggest activities that
      might be nice to do in the current weather, tips for things to do inside
      when weather is less favorable, and also show general news and information
      about the cities and areas that will have their information on the
      website. So people may show up to look at the weather, and see the
      forecast for the coming days, but the target audience is those people that
      will find the extra information useful and want to act on the things that
      they read. This could mean people of all demographics will find use in the
      site.

    <h2>Persona 1</h2>
    <p>
      Dale: Dale is a retired farmer who loves to golf and be outside. Since
      retiring he has not had much need for the internet. And other than
      ordering things off of the Amazon app on his phone, and reading the news,
      he does not spend much time involved with technology or browsing the web
      at all.
    </p>
    <h2>Persona 2</h2>
    <p>
      John: John is a college student who is studying psychology at his local
      college. He is on his laptop nearly every evening for homework and
      leisure, and knows his way around the web. He mostly uses his laptop for
      browsing, but occasionally will use his smartphone when no other option is
      present.
    </p>
    <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
    <p>
      Daryl & Merla: Daryl and his wife, Merla, are a retired couple living in
      Preston, Idaho. They moved there after busy careers back east in the city,
      and enjoy the rural, country aspect of being located in Preston. This
      summer, they are having a family reunion, and want to know the weather for
      the week that they will be having the reunion, as well as possible
      activities and events going on in the town during the reunion. They have
      an older computer in their home, and besides each having a smartphone that
      they know how to use for business and sending pictures to their kids, they
      are not too tech savvy. Alpha Forecast is catered to them to have a simple
      interface with weather, suggestions, and news artcles all easily
      accessible, and not crowded behind loads of weather stats and ads.
    </p>

      spring. He wants to plan the date for this weekend. He looks up the
      weather and clicks the link for our website. Once there he is easily able
      to search for the location of the hike and get the forecast for the
      weekend. It says that there is 80% chance of rain, but also gives a tip on
      what he can do in the area during the rain. He notices an article about a
      new movie theatre opening up in town, and that they are selling half price
      tickets for opening weekend. He also sees that multiple restraunts are
      having solid meal deals as well. He reasons that because of this, he can
      make a plan to head to dinner and the movies and also try and plan the
      group hike for another weekend. Coming back to Alpha Forecast because he

    <h2>Scenario 3</h2>
    <p>
      Nolan and Carol want to plan a fun day at the park for their kids to kick
      off summer vacation. They come to Alpha Forecast to look up the weather
      for this coming Saturday. They see that it will be gorgeous outside, and
      that there is also a small craft fair going on at the park they are
      wanting to go to, and decide to buy tickets to the fair. When they go, the
      kids have a fantastic time, and the weather is exactly as forecasted. And
      the craft fair isn't half bad either!
    </p>
    <h2>Scenario 4</h2>
    <p>
      Kelly is looking to go kayaking this weekend, and is hoping for a
      beautiful day. The forecast says that at the location she searches, the
      weather will be good. She also notices in a list of activities to do, that
      there is a kayak rental place that is offering great deals on weekend
      rentals. Kelly kills two birds with one stone, and gets the weather
      checked, and her kayak rented in one sitting. Making planning the rest of
      her trip a breeze.
    </p>
    <h2>Scenario 5</h2>
    <p>
      Sean wants to know the weather for tomorrow because he has the day off
      from work. He checks the weather and finds that it will be less than
      ideal, but because Alpha Forecast also offers simple suggestions to people
      based on the weather of the location, he sees a link to a site about
      things to do indoors when the weather is bad. Although Sean does not get
      the beautiful day he was hoping for, he starts to take an online web
      development course, and discovers that he absolutely loves it.
